# Seminar on Strategy Design Pattern

## Overview

This repository contains materials for a seminar on the **Strategy Design Pattern**, showcasing its use in real-world problem-solving scenarios. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows the dynamic selection of algorithms at runtime, promoting code flexibility and maintainability.

## Contents

### 1. Seminar PDF
The **"Strategy Design Pattern"** PDF is the seminar's primary resource and includes:
- **Definition**: Understanding the Strategy Pattern's role in software design.
- **Structure**: Class and sequence diagrams explaining the pattern's components.
- **Applications**: Real-world use cases, such as Spring Security and algorithm switching.
- **Advantages and Disadvantages**: Analysis of the pattern's benefits and challenges.
- **Practical Use Cases**: Demonstrates how to refactor solutions using the Strategy Pattern.

### 2. Projects in Java

#### Project 1: Understanding the Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the refactoring of a naive implementation into one using the Strategy Pattern.
- **Structure**:
  1. **Package 1: Without Strategy Pattern**  
     Contains the initial implementation of a problem with tightly coupled algorithms and rigid code.
  2. **Package 2: With Strategy Pattern**  
     Demonstrates how the initial implementation was refactored using the Strategy Pattern to decouple the algorithms and enable flexibility.

#### Project 2: Problem Solution with and without the Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Solves a given problem and highlights the difference in implementation with and without the Strategy Pattern.
- **Structure**:
  1. **Package 1: Solution Without Strategy Pattern**  
     Contains the solution to the problem using a straightforward approach without any design pattern.
  2. **Package 2: Solution With Strategy Pattern**  
     Refactors the solution to employ the Strategy Pattern, showcasing the benefits of decoupled and reusable code.

Each project is designed to help understand how the Strategy Pattern improves the maintainability and scalability of code.

### 3. React JS Example

#### Overview
This example demonstrates how the Strategy Pattern can be implemented in a React application without relying on interfaces, leveraging functional programming concepts.

#### Code
The React application dynamically switches between different strategies (addition, subtraction, multiplication) at runtime using React's state management.

```javascript
import "./index.css";
import { useState } from "react";

const addStrategy = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtractStrategy = (a, b) => a - b;
const multiplyStrategy = (a, b) => a * b;

function App() {
  const [strategy, setStrategy] = useState(() => addStrategy);
  const [result, setResult] = useState(0);

  const handleCalculation = (a, b) => {
    setResult(strategy(a, b));
  };

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>Strategy Pattern in React</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setStrategy(() => addStrategy)}>Add</button>
      <button onClick={() => setStrategy(() => subtractStrategy)}>Subtract</button>
      <button onClick={() => setStrategy(() => multiplyStrategy)}>Multiply</button>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => handleCalculation(5, 3)}>Calculate 5 and 3</button>
      </div>
      <div>Result: {result}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Flexibility**: Algorithms can be swapped dynamically at runtime.
- **Code Decoupling**: Separates the context and algorithms, promoting modularity.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Simplifies complex conditionals and makes the code easier to extend.
- **Language Independence**: The Strategy Pattern is adaptable across different languages and paradigms.
